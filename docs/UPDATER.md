# Updater Foundation

## Purpose

Phase 4A adds update check, signed manifest validation, package download to private storage, and package verification. It does not apply or install updates.

## Default State

The updater is disabled by default:

```text
UPDATER_ENABLED=false
```

No automatic update checks or automatic update apply actions are enabled for normal users.

## No GitHub Credentials On Client PCs

Client PCs must not contain:

- GitHub tokens
- deploy keys
- private repository URLs
- signing private keys
- update server secrets
- build machine credentials

Clients should receive signed release manifests and signed/checksummed packages through a trusted release server or controlled manual import workflow.

## Signed Manifest

The update manifest must be verified before it is trusted. Manifest data includes app id, latest version, minimum required version, update channel, release notes, mandatory flag, package URL, package checksum, package signature, migration flag, backup requirement, supported installation modes, and expiry.

The private signing key belongs only on the release/build side. The client app may contain a public verification key only.

## Package Verification

Packages are downloaded only to private updater temp storage outside `public/`. Phase 4A verifies packages but does not extract them into the app root.

Packages are rejected if they contain:

- `.env` or `.env.*`
- database files
- SQLite WAL/SHM files
- backups
- logs
- private storage
- credentials/secrets/private keys
- `.git/`
- `.github/`
- absolute paths
- path traversal entries

## Future Apply Requirements

Future update apply work must:

- require developer/admin action
- create and verify a backup first
- abort if backup fails
- validate package structure
- never overwrite client DB, `.env`, backups, logs, private storage, or uploads
- snapshot current app files for rollback
- test migrations on staging/copy first
- keep restore separate and never trigger restore automatically

## Phase 4A Boundary

Apply/install is intentionally not implemented. No route should replace app files, run migrations, run Composer update commands, or alter client data.
